                    My name is Nguyễn Phạm Thanh Huân, and I am a student at <b>Văn Lang University</b>. 
                    I would like to share a difficult experience I went through last year. 
                    <b>In August 2024,</b> while studying and working in Saigon, I suddenly developed a cough.

                    <u><b>When I returned to my hometown for Tet,</b></u>my mother insisted that I see a doctor. 
                    After a morning examination, I was admitted to the hospital that very afternoon. 
                    I had to stay in the hospital for 20 days and continued outpatient treatment for the next 6 months. 
                    I was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis, a disease that many people often avoid due to stigma, much like COVID-19.

                    During the treatment, I had to postpone my studies and put my grades on hold. 
                    <i><b>This experience taught me the importance of living a healthy lifestyle, exercising regularly, 
                    and maintaining good hygiene to boost the body's resistance against viruses.</b></i>
